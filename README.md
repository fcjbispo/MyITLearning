## Full-Stack Developer Training

This repository contains the starting materials and guidance for a comprehensive Full-Stack Developer training program. This initial course will cover the basics for modern JavaScript, frontend development (React), backend development (Node.js), UX/Design fundamentals, and integration with AI tools.

This course will use itself as a case study for the training program. The goal is to, when training, create a single platform to training Generative AI developers in unknown technologies in order to be familiar with it when developing with AI Agents support, or else, the course's final project isfinal its own training platform.

This project aims to be a self-training platform to gather missing skills to use when developing with AI Agents support.

The project will be implemented using layers implemented with branches, each one for a specific topic, technology or stack. Initially JavaScript and NodeJS will be covered. Further branches will be created for other stacks or the project evolution itself.

## Why this project?

This was a personal need, once I lack some JavaScript and NodeJS knowledge due my experience on JavaScript remains from its beginning on later 2000s. 

## Project Structure

- `/curso_full_stack`: Contains the training modules, lessons, exercises, and projects for the specific course.
- `/memory_bank`: Stores the AI agent's operational memory and progress tracking.
- `cursos.json`: An index of available training programs.
- `guia.md`: The main guide and instructions for the AI agent facilitating the training.
- `plano_treinamento.md`: The detailed training plan (located inside `/curso_full_stack`).

## Tools

- This project is being developed using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with support of Roo Code Assistant with local LLM via LMStudio and Google's Gemini edge free models.

## Getting Started

Further instructions on how to use this repository and the training program will be added as the project develops.
