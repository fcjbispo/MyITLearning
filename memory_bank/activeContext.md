# Active Context

This document tracks the current focus, recent changes, and next steps for the Full-Stack Developer Training project.

**Current Focus:** Initializing the memory bank and setting up the basic project structure.

**Recent Changes:**
- Moved `plano_treinamento.md` to `curso_full_stack/`.
- Created `cursos.json` with initial course information.
- Updated `guia.md` to include instructions on the memory bank and its location.
- Created the `memory_bank` directory.
- Created `memory_bank/projectbrief.md`.
- Created `memory_bank/productContext.md`.

**Next Steps:**
- Create remaining core memory bank files (`systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`).
- Confirm initialization of the memory bank.
- Proceed with the training based on the updated `guia.md` and `curso_full_stack/plano_treinamento.md`.

**Active Decisions and Considerations:**
- The memory bank will reside in the `memory_bank` directory.
- The `cursos.json` file will serve as a central index for available courses.

**Learnings and Project Insights:**
- The memory bank structure is crucial for maintaining context across sessions.
- Clear documentation in `guia.md` is essential for guiding the agent's behavior.
