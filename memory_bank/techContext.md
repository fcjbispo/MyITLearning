# Tech Context

This document details the technologies used and the development setup for the Full-Stack Developer Training project.

**Technologies Used:**
- Markdown: For documentation and course content.
- JSON: For structured data like the course index (`cursos.json`).
- Command Line Interface (CLI) tools: For file system operations and command execution.

**Development Setup:**
- VS Code environment with access to necessary tools.
- File system access for reading and writing files.

**Technical Constraints:**
- Reliance on available tools and their capabilities.
- Memory reset between sessions necessitates the use of the memory bank.

**Dependencies:**
- Access to the file system.
- Availability of CLI commands (e.g., for moving files).

**Tool Usage Patterns:**
- `read_file`: To access content of Markdown and JSON files.
- `write_to_file`: To create and update Markdown and JSON files.
- `apply_diff`: To make targeted modifications to existing files.
- `execute_command`: To perform system operations like moving files.
- `list_files`: To inspect directory contents.
- `ask_followup_question`: To clarify requirements with the user.
