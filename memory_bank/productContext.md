# Product Context

This project is a self-referential system designed to function as both a comprehensive full-stack development training program and the practical environment where this training is applied through the process of building the platform itself.

**Problem Solved:** This project addresses the need for developers, particularly those working with AI Agents, to acquire and enhance modern full-stack development skills through hands-on experience within a real-world project context. It specifically focuses on demonstrating and practicing development workflows that incorporate AI Agent support effectively.

**How it Should Work:** The project, guided by an AI Agent (like Roo), progresses through a defined training plan (`plano_treinamento.md`). Each step in the plan corresponds to a development task required to build or improve the platform. The AI Agent facilitates this process by:
- Interpreting the training topic as a development requirement.
- Utilizing tools (including AI-assisted ones) to implement the required functionality.
- Providing explanations and context on the concepts being implemented (acting as the "teacher").
- Documentando o processo e resultados (atualizando o banco de memória, código, etc.).
- The "user" or "learner" is primarily the AI Agent itself, whose "learning" is demonstrated by the successful construction and functionality of the platform components. Human users can observe, learn from the process, and potentially interact or contribute.

**User Experience Goals (primarily for observing humans and guiding AI Agent actions):**
- The project structure and documentation (`README.md`, `guia.md`, memory bank files) should clearly illustrate the training process and the role of AI Agents.
- The codebase should be well-structured and reflect the concepts being "taught" at each stage.
- The progress of the project/training should be easily trackable (`memory_bank/progress.md`).
- The process should demonstrate effective patterns for AI-assisted development.
- The resulting platform (as it's built) should eventually provide a functional example of a full-stack application.
