# Product Context: MyITLearning Platform

This project is a self-referential system designed to function as both a comprehensive full-stack development training program and the practical environment where this training is applied through the process of building the platform itself.

**Problem Solved:** This project addresses the need for developers, particularly those working with AI Agents, to acquire and enhance modern full-stack development skills through hands-on experience within a real-world project context. It specifically focuses on demonstrating and practicing development workflows that incorporate AI Agent support effectively, structured in layers/branches for focused learning and development.

**How it Should Work:** The MyITLearning platform, guided by an AI Agent (like Roo), progresses through a defined training plan (`curso_full_stack_js/plano_treinamento.md` initially, with other plans/folders for different stacks/layers). Each step in the plan corresponds to a development task required to build or improve a specific layer or component of the platform within its respective branch. The AI Agent facilitates this process by:
- Interpreting the training topic as a development requirement for the current layer/branch.
- Utilizing tools (including AI-assisted ones) to implement the required functionality within that layer.
- Providing explanations and context on the concepts being implemented (acting as the "teacher"), often documented within the relevant course folder (`curso_full_stack_js`, etc.) and memory bank.
- Documentando o processo e resultados (atualizando o banco de memória, código, etc.).
- The "user" or "learner" is primarily the AI Agent itself, whose "learning" is demonstrated by the successful construction and functionality of the platform components across different layers/branches. Human users can observe the evolution of the project through branches, learn from the process, and potentially interact or contribute.

**User Experience Goals (primarily for observing humans and guiding AI Agent actions):**
- The project structure, branches, and documentation (`README.md`, `guia.md`, memory bank files, course folders) should clearly illustrate the training process, the layer-based development, and the role of AI Agents.
- The codebase within each branch should be well-structured and reflect the concepts being "taught" at that stage.
- The progress of the project/training should be easily trackable (`memory_bank/progress.md`).
- The process should demonstrate effective patterns for AI-assisted development in a layered project.
- The resulting platform (as it's built across branches) should eventually provide functional examples of full-stack applications or components.
