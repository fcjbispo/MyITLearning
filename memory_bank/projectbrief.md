# Project Brief

This document outlines the core requirements and goals for the Full-Stack Developer Training project.

**Project Goal:** To build a self-training platform for acquiring and enhancing full-stack development skills, with a specific focus on developing *with the support of AI Agents*. The project itself serves as the case study and practical environment for this training.

**Key Requirements:**
- The project's construction process IS the training program.
- The platform should cover modern JavaScript, frontend (React), backend (Node.js), UX/Design fundamentals, and integration with AI tools.
- Utilize AI Agents not only as instructors but as active participants in the development process.
- Deliver structured training content based on a defined plan (`plano_treinamento.md`) that also serves as a development roadmap.
- Organize course materials and project artifacts logically in dedicated directories (`curso_full_stack` and others as needed).
- Maintain a record of project progress and training completion (`memory_bank/progress.md`).
- Utilize available tools (including AI-assisted ones) for content discovery, implementation, and integration.
- The project should demonstrate best practices for development workflows incorporating AI Agent support.
- Store all operational memory and context files in the `memory_bank` directory.
