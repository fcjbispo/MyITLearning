# Progress

This document tracks the progress of the Full-Stack Developer Training.

**Current Status:** Initial setup and memory bank initialization are in progress.

**Completed Items:**
- Moved `plano_treinamento.md` to `curso_full_stack/`.
- Created `cursos.json`.
- Updated `guia.md` with memory bank instructions.
- Created `memory_bank` directory.
- Created core memory bank files:
    - `memory_bank/projectbrief.md`
    - `memory_bank/productContext.md`
    - `memory_bank/activeContext.md`
    - `memory_bank/systemPatterns.md`
    - `memory_bank/techContext.md`

**Remaining Items:**
- Create AI agents for searching, formatting, and adding training materials according to the configurations for each course (architecture and development (backend, frontend, services, unit and integration tests, etc.)).
- Create the interface for applying the existing training programs (architecture and development (backend, frontend, services, unit and integration tests, etc.)).
- Track progress of each session and topic in this file.
- Continuously update memory bank files as needed.

**Known Issues:**
- None at this time.

**Evolution of Project Decisions:**
- Decision to store memory bank files in a dedicated `memory_bank` directory for better organization.
